## Verify MAKES releases

MAKES release are deployed approximately every two weeks to the Azure storage account that were used to signed up for the distribution preview. When new versions of MAKES are released, a new folder will be created under the "makes" dataset with the release version being the folder name.  This folder contains all the elements required to self-host an instance of MAKES. Let's verify that MAKES has been published to your subscription successfully.
