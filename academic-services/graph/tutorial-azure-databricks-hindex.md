# Tutorial: Compute author h-index using Azure Databricks

In this tutorial, you compute h-index for all authors in Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) using Azure Databricks. You extract data from Azure Storage into data frames, compute h-index, and visualize the result in table and graph forms.

## Prerequisites

Complete these tasks before you begin this tutorial:

* Setting up provisioning of Microsoft Academic Graph to an Azure blob storage account. See [Get Microsoft Academic Graph on Azure storage](get-started-setup-provisioning.md).

* Setting up Azure Databricks service. See [Set up Azure Databricks](get-started-setup-databricks.md).

## Gather the information that you need

   Before you begin, you should have these items of information:

   :heavy_check_mark:  The name of your Azure Storage (AS) account containing MAG dataset from [Get Microsoft Academic Graph on Azure storage](get-started-setup-provisioning.md#note-azure-storage-account-name-and-primary-key).

   :heavy_check_mark:  The access key of your Azure Storage (AS) account from [Get Microsoft Academic Graph on Azure storage](get-started-setup-provisioning.md#note-azure-storage-account-name-and-primary-key).

   :heavy_check_mark:  The name of the container in your Azure Storage (AS) account containing MAG dataset.

## Import PySparkMagClass.py as a notebook

In this section, you import PySparkMagClass.py as a notebook in Azure Databricks workspace. This utility notebook will be called from another notebook later.

1. Save samples\PySparkMagClass.py in MAG dataset to local drive.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), go to the Azure Databricks service that you created, and select **Launch Workspace**.

1. On the left, select **Workspace**. From the **Workspace** drop-down, select **Import**.

    ![Import a notebook in Databricks](media/databricks/import-notebook.png "import notebook in Databricks")

   |     978|      Ximena Faúndez|             162148367|        18|
   +--------+--------------------+----------------------+----------+
   only showing top 3 rows
   ``` 

1. Get **(Author, Paper) pairs**. Paste the following code in a new cell.

   ```python
   # Get (author, paper) pairs
   PaperAuthorAffiliations = MAG.getDataframe('PaperAuthorAffiliations')
   AuthorPaper = PaperAuthorAffiliations.select(PaperAuthorAffiliations.AuthorId, PaperAuthorAffiliations.PaperId).distinct()
   AuthorPaper.show(3)
   AuthorPaper.createOrReplaceTempView('AuthorPaper')
   ```

   +----------+--------+
   only showing top 3 rows
   ``` 

1. Get **Papers**. Paste the following code in a new cell.

   ```python
   # Get paper citation
   Papers = MAG.getDataframe('Papers')
   PaperCitation = Papers.select(Papers.PaperId, Papers.EstimatedCitation).where(Papers.EstimatedCitation > 0)
   PaperCitation.show(3)
   PaperCitation.createOrReplaceTempView('PaperCitation')
   ```

   Press the **SHIFT + ENTER** keys to run the code in this block. You see an output similar to the following snippet:

   ```
   +----------+-----------------+
   |   PaperId|EstimatedCitation|

   -- Order author, paper, citation view by citation
   CREATE OR REPLACE TEMPORARY VIEW AuthorPaperOrderByCitation
       AS SELECT
           AuthorId,
           PaperId,
           EstimatedCitation,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY AuthorId ORDER BY EstimatedCitation DESC) AS Rank
       FROM AuthorPaperCitation;
   ```

   Press the **SHIFT + ENTER** keys to run the code in this block. You see following output:

   ```
   OK
   ```

1. **Compute h-index for all authors**. Paste the following code in a new cell.

   CREATE OR REPLACE TEMPORARY VIEW AuthorHIndexTemp
       AS SELECT
           AuthorId,
           SUM(EstimatedCitation) AS TotalEstimatedCitation,
           MAX(CASE WHEN EstimatedCitation >= Rank THEN Rank ELSE 0 END) AS HIndex
       FROM AuthorPaperOrderByCitation 
       GROUP BY AuthorId;
   ```

   Press the **SHIFT + ENTER** keys to run the code in this block. You see following output:

   ```
   OK
   ```

1. **Get author detail information**. Paste the following code in a new cell.

   ```sql

   CREATE OR REPLACE TEMPORARY VIEW AuthorHIndex
       AS SELECT
           I.AuthorId,
           A.DisplayName,
           AF.DisplayName AS AffiliationDisplayName,
           A.PaperCount,
           I.TotalEstimatedCitation,
           I.HIndex
       FROM AuthorHIndexTemp AS I
       INNER JOIN Authors AS A
           ON A.AuthorId == I.AuthorId
       LEFT OUTER JOIN Affiliations AS AF
           ON A.LastKnownAffiliationId == AF.AffiliationId;
   ```

   Press the **SHIFT + ENTER** keys to run the code in this block. You see following output:

   ```
   OK
   ```

## Query and visualize result 

In this section, you query top authors by h-index and visualize the result.

1. Query top authors with highest h-index. Paste the following code in a new cell. Press the **SHIFT + ENTER** keys to run the code in this block.

   ```sql
   %sql
   -- Filter authors with top hindex
   SELECT
       DisplayName,
       AffiliationDisplayName,
       PaperCount,
       TotalEstimatedCitation,
       HIndex
   FROM AuthorHIndex 
   ORDER BY HIndex DESC, AuthorId
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

1. Select the **table** icon to see result in table form.

   ![Author H-Index table](media/databricks/hindex-table.png "Verify sample table")

1. Select the **graph** icon to see result in graph form.

   ![Author H-Index graph](media/databricks/hindex-graph.png "Verify sample table")

## Clean up resources

After you finish the tutorial, you can terminate the cluster. From the Azure Databricks workspace, select **Clusters** on the left. For the cluster to terminate, under **Actions**, point to the ellipsis (...) and select the **Terminate** icon.

![Stop a Databricks cluster](media/databricks/terminate-databricks-cluster.png "Stop a Databricks cluster")

If you don't manually terminate the cluster, it automatically stops, provided you selected the **Terminate after \_\_ minutes of inactivity** check box when you created the cluster. In such a case, the cluster automatically stops if it's been inactive for the specified time.
