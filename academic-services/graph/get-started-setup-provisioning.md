## Pre-requisites

- [Azure account + subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/get-started)
- [Azure Storage account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/)

## Setup storage account to receive MAG graph releases

### [Create an Azure Subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/get-started)

Please create a new Azure subscription for the distribution previews. If your organization already using Azure, this could be a separate subscription under the same tenant id. If you start from scratch, for example “create Azure free account”, the subscription will be created under a new tenant id.

### [Create an Azure Storage Account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-quickstart-create-account?tabs=portal)

1. Home > Create a resource > Storage > Storage account

    ![Create new storage account resource](media/create-storage-account-select.png "Create new storage account resource")

1. Specify "mag" for the resource group, “magas<org_name>” for the account name, "Storage (general purpose v1)" for account kind, “LRS” for replication, and “standard” for performance, then click the "review + create" button

    ![Enter details for new storage account resource](media/create-storage-account-details.png "Enter details for new storage account resource")

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > You don’t need to use your organization name after the "magas", however the account name must be unique among all Azure Storage Accounts

    > [!NOTE]
    > Select whatever location (region) that is most appropriate for your existing Azure resources

1. Verify that the information you entered is correct and click the "create" button

    ![Submit new storage account resource for creation](media/create-storage-account-submit.png "Submit new storage account resource for creation")

1. Once notified that the storage account has been created, click “go to resource”

    ![Navigate to the new storage account resource](media/create-storage-account-go-to-resource.png "Navigate to the new storage account resource")

1. Go to “access keys” and take note of the “storage account name” and the “primary key”

    ![Save new storage account resource name and access keys for later](media/create-storage-account-access-keys.png "Save new storage account resource name and access keys for later")

## Sign up for MAG provisioning

To sign up for MAG on AS distribution preview, send the following information to <a href="mailto:academicapi@microsoft.com?subject=Access request to Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) on Azure Storage (AS) distribution preview">academicapi@microsoft.com</a> with the subject "Access request to Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) on Azure Storage (AS) distribution preview":

- Are you affiliated with a company or university?
  - If company, please provide the company’s name, your department/group and your role
  - If university, please provide the university’s name, department, group/advisor, and your role (undergraduate student, grad student, professor, etc.)
- Brief description of the project you will be using MAG for
- Name of your Microsoft sales representative, if you have one
- Azure storage account name
- Azure storage account primary access key
- Which type of provisioning model you want:
  1. One-time provisioning of the most recent MAG release
  1. Automatic provisioning of each new MAG release (~every 1-2 weeks)

> [!NOTE]
> MAG is currently in a free preview period, so there are no charges associated with the provisioning or use of the data/service itself. However Azure requires you to cover all costs associated with standard resource creation, usage, etc. For cost estimates associated with MAG please see the [Pricing](resources-pricing.md) page. <br/><br/>Most research institutions have an "Enterprise Account" with Microsoft including Azure subscription. The pricing for Enterprise Accounts differ from the individual account shown in Azure's price calculator. <br/><br/>If you have an Enterprise Account, please check with your individual institution's Information Technology/Computer Center resource on the process of setting up Azure to get MAG. You might need to obtain a "Master Agreement #" and involve MLSP (Microsoft Licensed Solution Provider) for help.
