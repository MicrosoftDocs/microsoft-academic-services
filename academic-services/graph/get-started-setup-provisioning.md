## Setup storage account to receive MAG graph releases

### [Create an Azure Subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/get-started)

Please create a new Azure subscription for the distribution previews. If your organization already using Azure, this could be a separate subscription under the same tenant id. If you start from scratch, for example “create Azure free account”, the subscription will be created under a new tenant id.

### [Create an Azure Storage Account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-quickstart-create-account?tabs=portal)

1. Home > Create a resource > Storage > Storage account

    ![Create new storage account resource](media/create-storage-account/select.png "Create new storage account resource")

1.  Provide following values to create an Azure Storage account. Then click "Review + create" button.

    |Property  |Description  |
    |---------|---------|
    |**Subscription** | From the drop-down, select your Azure subscription. |
    |**Resource group** | Specify whether you want to create a new resource group or use an existing one. A resource group is a container that holds related resources for an Azure solution. For more information, see [Azure Resource Group overview](http://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview). |
    |**Storage account name** | Provide a name for your Databricks workspace, e.g. **magas<org_name>**. You don’t need to use your organization name after the "magas", however the account name must be unique among all Azure Storage Accounts. |
    |**Location**    | Select whatever location (region) that is most appropriate for your existing Azure resources |
    |**Performance** | Standard |
    |**Account kind**| StorageV2 (general purpose v2) |
    |**Replication** | LRS |
    |**Access tier** | Cool |

    ![Navigate to the new storage account resource](media/create-storage-account/go-to-resource.png "Navigate to the new storage account resource")

1. Go to “access keys” and take note of the “storage account name” and the “primary key”

    ![Save new storage account resource name and access keys for later](media/create-storage-account/access-keys.png "Save new storage account resource name and access keys for later")

1. Make sure that you have these items of information:

   :heavy_check_mark:  The name of your Azure Storage (AS) account.

   :heavy_check_mark:  The access key of Azure Storage (AS) account.

## Sign up for MAG provisioning

To sign up for MAG on AS distribution preview, send the following information using your school or company email account to <a href="mailto:academicapi@microsoft.com?subject=Access request to Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) on Azure Storage (AS) distribution preview">academicapi@microsoft.com</a> with the subject "Access request to Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) on Azure Storage (AS) distribution preview":

- Are you affiliated with a company or university?
  - If company, please provide the company’s name, your department/group and your role
  - If university, please provide the university’s name, department, group/advisor, and your role (undergraduate student, grad student, professor, etc.)
- Brief description of the project you will be using MAG for
- Name of your Microsoft sales representative, if you have one
- Azure Storage (AS) account name
- Azure Storage (AS) account primary access key
- Which type of provisioning model you want:
  1. One-time provisioning of the most recent MAG release
  1. Automatic provisioning of each new MAG release (~every 1-2 weeks)

> [!NOTE]
> MAG is currently in a free preview period, so there are no charges associated with the provisioning or use of the data/service itself. However Azure requires you to cover all costs associated with standard resource creation, usage, etc. For cost estimates associated with MAG please see the [Pricing](resources-pricing.md) page. <br/><br/>Most research institutions have an "Enterprise Account" with Microsoft including Azure subscription. The pricing for Enterprise Accounts differ from the individual account shown in Azure's price calculator. <br/><br/>If you have an Enterprise Account, please check with your individual institution's Information Technology/Computer Center resource on the process of setting up Azure to get MAG. You might need to obtain a "Master Agreement #" and involve MLSP (Microsoft Licensed Solution Provider) for help.
